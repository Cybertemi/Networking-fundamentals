📡 README: Networking Fundamentals

🔍 Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to networking fundamentals including the OSI model, IPv4 subnet calculations and TCP/IP protocol suite analysis. It is designed to help learners and professionals understand key networking concepts essential for network configuration, troubleshooting, and security.

🌐 1. OSI (Open System Interconnection) Model

The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers:

📶 Physical Layer: Transmits raw bits over a physical medium (Ethernet cables and Wi-Fi signals).

🔗 Data Link Layer: Ensures error-free data transfer using MAC addresses (network switches).

📡 Network Layer: Routes packets across networks using IP addresses (routers).

📨 Transport Layer: Ensures reliable transmission via TCP or fast transfer via UDP (e.g video streaming).

🖥️ Session Layer: Manages sessions between applications (e.g SSH login to a remote server).

🔐 Presentation Layer: Translates data formats and ensures encryption (e.g SSL/TLS for HTTPS traffic).

🌍 Application Layer: Provides networked applications and services (e.g web browsers, messaging apps).

📌 2. IPv4 Subnet Calculation

Understanding subnetting is crucial for efficient IP address allocation and network segmentation. Below are the results of an IPv4 subnet calculation:

🖥️ IP Address: 192.168.1.1

🌎 Network Address: 192.168.1.0

📌 Usable Host IP Range: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.62

📡 Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.63

📊 Total Number of Hosts: 64

✅ Number of Usable Hosts: 62

🎭 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192

📍 CIDR Notation: /26

🔒 IP Type: Private

This calculation helps in designing efficient network architectures and managing IP address allocation effectively.

🚀 3. TCP/IP Protocol Suite Analysis: Loading a Web Page

The TCP/IP model is used for network communication and ensuring successful data transmission. Below is how the layers work together when loading a web page like https://www.linkedin.com:

📡 Network Access Layer: Handles the physical transmission of data over cables, Wi-Fi routers or Ethernet.

🌍 Internet Layer: Encapsulates TCP segments into IP packets containing source and destination IP addresses.

📨 Transport Layer: Uses TCP to break the request into segments and establishes a connection via a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK and ACK).

🔐 Application Layer: HTTPS is used to request and load the web page from the server.

💡 Real-World Scenario:

🖥️ A user enters https://www.linkedin.com in a web browser.

🌐 DNS resolves the domain name to an IP address.

🔗 A TCP connection is established with the web server.

📩 An HTTPS request is sent by the browser.

📡 The web server responds with the requested web page.

🖥️ The browser reconstructs the received data and displays it.

🎯 NOTE

 Understanding these concepts is essential for network engineers, security professionals and IT administrators.
