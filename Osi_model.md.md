## OSI model

The OSI (Open System Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that narrates how packets are being transferred using its seven layers

##1. Physical Layer
-Function: transmits raw bites over physical medium

-Real world example: Ethernet cables and Wi-Fi signals

##2. Data Link Layer
-Function: ensures error free data transfer between two devices using MAC addresses.

-Real world example: Network switch

##3. Network Layer
-Function: routes packets across networks using IP addresses

-Real world example:Router for traffic direction

##4. Transport Layer
-Function: using TCP/IP, it ensures reliable transmission and fast transfer using UDP.

-Real world example: the use of TCP/IP to stream a video 

##5. Session Layer
-Function: it manages sessions between two applications

-Real world example: Using SSH to login to a remote server 

##6. Presentation Layer
-Function: it translates data formats like encryption

-Real world example: the use of SSL/TLS for encryption of HTTPS web traffic

##7. Application Layer
-Function: it provides networked application and services that enables communication.

-Real world example: web browsers and messaging apps with interfaces
